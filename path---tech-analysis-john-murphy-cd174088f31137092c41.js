The fundamentalist always\nhas to know why.\nMarket price acts as a leading indicator of the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>ANALYSIS VERSUS TIMING</h3>\n<h3>FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h3>\n<h3>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TRADING MEDIUMS</h3>\n<h3>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TIME DIMENSIONS</h3>\n<p>It has been suggested by some that fundamental analysis should be used for long term forecasting with technical factors limited to short term timing. The fact is that longer range\nforecasting, using weekly and monthly charts going back several years, has proven to be\nan extremely useful application on these techniques.</p>\n<h3>LESS RELIANCE ON MARKET AVERAGES AND INDICATORS</h3>\n<p>Stock market analysis is based heavily on the movement of broad market averages—\nsuch as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&#x26;P 500. In addition, technical indicators that measure the strength or weakness of the broader market— like the NYSE advance-decline line or the new highs-new lows list—are heavily employed.</p>\n<h2>Chapter 2. Dow Theory</h2>\n<h3>BASIC TENETS</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Averages Discount Everything.</li>\n<li>The Market Has Three Trends.\nDow believes that the law of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, “Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to decline some distance”. Dow considered a trend to have three parts, <em>primary</em>, <em>secondary</em>, and <em>minor</em>, which he compared to the tide, waves. and ripples of the sea.</li>\n<li>Major Trends Have Three Phases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Accumulation phase:</p>\n<p>Participation phase:</p>\n<p>Distribution phase:</p>\n<ol start="4">\n<li>The Averages Must Confirm Each Other.\nDow meant that no important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other.</li>\n<li>Volume Must Confirm the Trend.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, <em>volume should expand or increase in the direction of the major trend</em>.</p>\n<ol start="6">\n<li>A Trend Is Assumed to Be in Effect Until It Gives Definite Signals That It Has Reversed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in\nmotion until some external force causes it to change direction.</p>\n<p>The most difficult task for a Dow theorist, or any trend-follower for that matter, it being able to distinguish between a normal\nsecondary correction in an existing trend and the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p><strong>THE USE OF CLOSING PRICES AND THE PRESENCE OF LINES</strong></p>\n<h2>Chapter 4. Basic Concepts of Trend</h2>\n<p><strong>DEFINITION OF TREND</strong>\nIn a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the market, which way it’s moving. Market moves are characterized by a series of <em>zigzags</em>.\nThese zigzags resemble a series of successive waves with fairly obvious\npeaks and troughs. <em>It is the direction of those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend</em>.\n<img src="/trend-f1fd388e9541a3962789e862e835ae0b.gif" alt="trend">\n<strong>TREND HAS THREE DIRECTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve mentioned an uptrend, downtrend, and sideways trend for a very good reason. Most technical tools and systems are trend-following in nature, which means that they are primarily designed for markets that are moving up or down, They usually work very poorly, or not at all, when markets enter these lateral or “trendless” phases.</p>\n<p>There are three decisions confronting the trader— whether to buy a market, sell a market, or do nothing. When a market is rising, the buying strategy is preferable. When it is falling, the second approach would be correct. However, when the market is moving sideways, the third choice— to stay out of the market— is usually the wisest.</p>\n<p><strong>TREND HAS THREE CLASSIFICATION</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Major,</li>\n<li>Intermediate, and</li>\n<li>Near term trends.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each trend becomes a portion of its next larger trend.\n\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-6c011.png"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 47.86585365853659%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="trend-classification"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-fb8a0.png"\n        srcset="/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-1a291.png 148w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-2bc4a.png 295w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-fb8a0.png 590w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-526de.png 885w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-6c011.png 984w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \nAs a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes.\nIn an intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate long positions.</p>\n<p><strong>SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE</strong>\nThe troughs, or reaction lows, are called <em>support</em>. The term is self-explanatory and\nindicates that support is a level or area on the chart under the market where buying interest\nis sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and\nprices turn back up again. Usually a support level is identified beforehand by a previous reaction low.</p>\n<p>Resistance is the opposite of support and represents a price level or area over the market where\nselling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back. Usually a resistance\nlevel is identified by previous peak.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Technical Analysis of Financial Markets-- John Murphy",date:"May 01, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/tech-analysis/John-Murphy/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/tech-analysis/"},frontmatter:{title:"技术分析-学习笔记"}},next:null}}}});
