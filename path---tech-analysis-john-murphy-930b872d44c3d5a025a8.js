The fundamentalist always\nhas to know why.\nMarket price acts as a leading indicator of the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>ANALYSIS VERSUS TIMING</h3>\n<h3>FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h3>\n<h3>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TRADING MEDIUMS</h3>\n<h3>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TIME DIMENSIONS</h3>\n<p>It has been suggested by some that fundamental analysis should be used for long term forecasting with technical factors limited to short term timing. The fact is that longer range\nforecasting, using weekly and monthly charts going back several years, has proven to be\nan extremely useful application on these techniques.</p>\n<h3>LESS RELIANCE ON MARKET AVERAGES AND INDICATORS</h3>\n<p>Stock market analysis is based heavily on the movement of broad market averages—\nsuch as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&#x26;P 500. In addition, technical indicators that measure the strength or weakness of the broader market— like the NYSE advance-decline line or the new highs-new lows list—are heavily employed.</p>\n<h2>Chapter 2. Dow Theory</h2>\n<h3>BASIC TENETS</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Averages Discount Everything.</li>\n<li>The Market Has Three Trends.\nDow believes that the law of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, “Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to decline some distance”. Dow considered a trend to have three parts, <em>primary</em>, <em>secondary</em>, and <em>minor</em>, which he compared to the tide, waves. and ripples of the sea.</li>\n<li>Major Trends Have Three Phases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Accumulation phase:</p>\n<p>Participation phase:</p>\n<p>Distribution phase:</p>\n<ol start="4">\n<li>The Averages Must Confirm Each Other.\nDow meant that no important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other.</li>\n<li>Volume Must Confirm the Trend.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, <em>volume should expand or increase in the direction of the major trend</em>.</p>\n<ol start="6">\n<li>A Trend Is Assumed to Be in Effect Until It Gives Definite Signals That It Has Reversed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in\nmotion until some external force causes it to change direction.</p>\n<p>The most difficult task for a Dow theorist, or any trend-follower for that matter, it being able to distinguish between a normal\nsecondary correction in an existing trend and the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p><strong>THE USE OF CLOSING PRICES AND THE PRESENCE OF LINES</strong>\nDow relied exclusively on <em>closing prices</em>. He believed that averages had to close higher than a previous peak or lower than a previous trough to have significance.</p>\n<h2>Chapter 4. Basic Concepts of Trend</h2>\n<p><strong>DEFINITION OF TREND</strong>\nIn a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the market, which way it’s moving. Market moves are characterized by a series of <em>zigzags</em>.\nThese zigzags resemble a series of successive waves with fairly obvious\npeaks and troughs. <em>It is the direction of those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend</em>.\n<img src="/trend-f1fd388e9541a3962789e862e835ae0b.gif" alt="trend">\n<strong>TREND HAS THREE DIRECTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve mentioned an uptrend, downtrend, and sideways trend for a very good reason. Most technical tools and systems are trend-following in nature, which means that they are primarily designed for markets that are moving up or down, They usually work very poorly, or not at all, when markets enter these lateral or “trendless” phases.</p>\n<p>There are three decisions confronting the trader— whether to buy a market, sell a market, or do nothing. When a market is rising, the buying strategy is preferable. When it is falling, the second approach would be correct. However, when the market is moving sideways, the third choice— to stay out of the market— is usually the wisest.</p>\n<p><strong>TREND HAS THREE CLASSIFICATION</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Major,</li>\n<li>Intermediate, and</li>\n<li>Near term trends.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each trend becomes a portion of its next larger trend.\n\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-6c011.png"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 47.86585365853659%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAIAAAA7N+mxAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABtklEQVQoz11Sa2+bMBTl//+VfdiHKF21tlGzoiUZJRCeDg/bmIdNkqaEJIUC0XYBadImXVnHls895z4kxxaWxS0rsyEc4Th5j20RBO9RdKH0QknJoqu2xrbNPe/NcQRCe0LOjH1IIu+4aIVoueg4byHyvMvzmxBdGldZ9sl5I/Lb3fRRWTrKEllGjEmh63Q6laU0/UyS+m/AlZDS997iuDZ0spI1kTXaBlt2ov00v36ZPN49TycP+obNZur/5LhXa3QN309my1dn/l2ef3tRFHd/+E1RpiveaoU8bw+eCS4l+Ar8fyKpXMSfHl4MkwGH0TJmH2FYeP4xYleoTogbpWdoCpBBuUpTkK1AOeOtvNo83T/zvvKOsWuIT9AnjE+QF5TG0mh0CfyjJHjfKiBDqyBlSN5BNiInxi5+cPS8w0CrR41RBjAMAjJKy4W5VrZJWvsop7gwzCjEBcYl0GCK2+0Bfo++hrMerkAebMdpZamB/ENVfjmL+etiYYLPiJ6HsTWDTgMBeAQDbkG5J7vuDuytVewHxVollpmBH3h03RyhHSjDzgA2jHiL9rBFyN3BexieYH/+ALwZEGBCflRKAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="trend-classification"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-fb8a0.png"\n        srcset="/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-1a291.png 148w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-2bc4a.png 295w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-fb8a0.png 590w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-526de.png 885w,\n/static/trend-classification-8024cd63a04b82b2df10a11f0b6a5dac-6c011.png 984w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \nAs a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes.\nIn an intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate long positions.</p>\n<p><strong>SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE</strong>\nThe troughs, or reaction lows, are called <em>support</em>. The term is self-explanatory and\nindicates that support is a level or area on the chart under the market where buying interest\nis sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and\nprices turn back up again. Usually a support level is identified beforehand by a previous reaction low.</p>\n<p>Resistance is the opposite of support and represents a price level or area over the market where\nselling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back. Usually a resistance\nlevel is identified by previous peak.</p>\n<p><strong>How Support and Resistance Levels Reverse Their Roles</strong></p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/double-b47ada46ff8be05a8e239d190c29526f-58b4b.png"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 71.95902688860436%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="double"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/double-b47ada46ff8be05a8e239d190c29526f-fb8a0.png"\n        srcset="/static/double-b47ada46ff8be05a8e239d190c29526f-1a291.png 148w,\n/static/double-b47ada46ff8be05a8e239d190c29526f-2bc4a.png 295w,\n/static/double-b47ada46ff8be05a8e239d190c29526f-fb8a0.png 590w,\n/static/double-b47ada46ff8be05a8e239d190c29526f-58b4b.png 781w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>The Psychology of Support and Resistance</strong></p>\n<p>In a financial market, there are three types of participants, at any given price level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traders who are long and waiting for price to rise</li>\n<li>Traders who are short and hoping that price will fall</li>\n<li>Traders who have not decided which way to trade</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As price rises from a support level, the traders who are long are happy and may consider adding to their positions if price drops back down to the same support level. The traders who are short in this situation are beginning to question their positions, and may buy to cover (exit the position) to get out at, or near, breakeven, if price reaches the support level again. The traders who did not enter the market previously at this price level, may be ready to pounce and go long, if price comes back down to the support level. In essence, a large number of traders may be eagerly waiting to buy at this level, adding to its strength as an area of support. If all these participants do buy at this level, price will likely rebound from the support once again.</p>\n<p>Price can, however, fall right through the support level. As price continues to drop, traders will quickly realize that the support level is not holding. The long traders may wait for price to climb back up to the previous support level, which will now act as resistance, to exit their trades in the hopes of limiting their losses. The short traders are now happy and may consider adding to their positions, if price revisits the price level. Lastly, the traders who did not enter the market yet may go short, if price comes back to the previous support level, in anticipation of price dropping further. Again, a large number of traders may be ready to make a move at this level, but now instead of buying, they will be selling. This same behavior can be witnessed in reverse with traders’ reactions to resistance levels.</p>\n<p><strong>The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or resistance area, the more significant that area becomes.</strong> For example, if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before moving higher, that support are would be more import than if only three days of trading had occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Volume is another way to measure the significance of support and resistance.</strong> If a support level is formed on heavy volume, this would indicate that a large number of units changed hands, and would mark that support level as more important than if very little trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure intraday trading activity are especially useful in identifying these price levels where most of the trading took place and, consequently, where support and resistance will be most likely to function.</p>\n<p><strong>A third way to determine the significance of a support or resistance area is how recently the trading took place.</strong>\nBecause  we are dealing with the reaction of traders to market movement and to positions that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Support Becoming Resistance and Vice Versa: Degree of Penetration.</strong>\nIt was mentioned earlier that the distance prices traveled away from support or resistance increased the significance of that support or resistance. There is quite a bit of subjectivity involved here in determining whether a penetration is significant or not. As a benchmark, some chartists use a 3% penetration as a criteria, particularly for major support and resistance levels. Shorter term support and resistance areas would probably require a much smaller number, like 1%.</p>\n<p><strong>The Importance of Round Numbers as Support and Resistance</strong></p>\n<p>There  is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines. Traders tend to think in terms of important round numbers, such as 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as price objectives and act accordingly. These round numbers, therefore, will often act as “Pyschological” support or resistance levels. A trader can use this information to begin taking profits as an important round number is approached.\nOne trading application of this principle is to <strong>avoid placing trading orders right at these obvious round numbers</strong>.\nAs a general rule, <strong>avoid placing protective stops at obvious round numbers</strong>.\nIn other words, protective stops on long positions should be placed below round numbers and on short positions, above such numbers.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Technical Analysis of Financial Markets-- John Murphy",date:"May 01, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/tech-analysis/John-Murphy/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/tech-analysis/"},frontmatter:{title:"技术分析-学习笔记"}},next:null}}}});
