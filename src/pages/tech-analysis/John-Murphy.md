Technical Analysis is the study of market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the
purpose of forecasting future price trends.
##Chapter 1. Philosophy of Technical Analysis
###PHILOSOPHY OR RATIONALE
1. Market action discounts everything.

The technician believes that anything can possibly affect the price- fundamentally, politically,
psychologically, or otherwise--is actually reflected in the price of that market.
All of the technical tools discussed later on are simply techniques users to aid the chartist
knows there are reasons why markets go up or down. He or she just doesn't believe that knowing what those reasons are is necessary in the forecasting process.
2. Prices move in trends.

Example of an uptrend. Technical analysis is based on the premise that markets trend and that those trends tend to persist.
corollary: **A trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse.**

3. History repeats itself.
The key to understanding the future lies in a study of the past, or that the future is just a repetition of the past.

###TECHNICAL VERSUS FUNDAMENTAL FORECASTING

*The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, while the technician studies
the effect.* The technician , of course, believe that the effect is all that he or she wants
or needs to know and that the reasons, or the causes, are unnecessary. The fundamentalist always
has to know why.
Market price acts as a leading indicator of the fundamentals.

###ANALYSIS VERSUS TIMING
###FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
###TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TRADING MEDIUMS
###TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TIME DIMENSIONS
It has been suggested by some that fundamental analysis should be used for long term forecasting with technical factors limited to short term timing. The fact is that longer range
forecasting, using weekly and monthly charts going back several years, has proven to be
an extremely useful application on these techniques.
###LESS RELIANCE ON MARKET AVERAGES AND INDICATORS
Stock market analysis is based heavily on the movement of broad market averages--
such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. In addition, technical indicators that measure the strength or weakness of the broader market-- like the NYSE advance-decline line or the new highs-new lows list--are heavily employed.

##Chapter 2. Dow Theory
###BASIC TENETS
1. The Averages Discount Everything.
2. The Market Has Three Trends.
Dow believes that the law of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, "Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to decline some distance". Dow considered a trend to have three parts, *primary*, *secondary*, and *minor*, which he compared to the tide, waves. and ripples of the sea.
3. Major Trends Have Three Phases.

Accumulation phase:

Participation phase:

Distribution phase:
4. The Averages Must Confirm Each Other.
Dow meant that no important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other.
5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend.

Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, *volume should expand or increase in the direction of the major trend*.

6. A Trend Is Assumed to Be in Effect Until It Gives Definite Signals That It Has Reversed.

It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in
motion until some external force causes it to change direction.

The most difficult task for a Dow theorist, or any trend-follower for that matter, it being able to distinguish between a normal
secondary correction in an existing trend and the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction.
