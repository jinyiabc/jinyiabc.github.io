Technical Analysis is the study of market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the
purpose of forecasting future price trends.
##Chapter 1. Philosophy of Technical Analysis
###PHILOSOPHY OR RATIONALE
1. Market action discounts everything.

The technician believes that anything can possibly affect the price- fundamentally, politically,
psychologically, or otherwise--is actually reflected in the price of that market.
All of the technical tools discussed later on are simply techniques users to aid the chartist
knows there are reasons why markets go up or down. He or she just doesn't believe that knowing what those reasons are is necessary in the forecasting process.
2. Prices move in trends.

Example of an uptrend. Technical analysis is based on the premise that markets trend and that those trends tend to persist.
corollary: **A trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse.**

3. History repeats itself.
The key to understanding the future lies in a study of the past, or that the future is just a repetition of the past.

###TECHNICAL VERSUS FUNDAMENTAL FORECASTING

*The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, while the technician studies
the effect.* The technician , of course, believe that the effect is all that he or she wants
or needs to know and that the reasons, or the causes, are unnecessary. The fundamentalist always
has to know why.
Market price acts as a leading indicator of the fundamentals.

###ANALYSIS VERSUS TIMING
###FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
###TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TRADING MEDIUMS
###TECHNICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TIME DIMENSIONS
It has been suggested by some that fundamental analysis should be used for long term forecasting with technical factors limited to short term timing. The fact is that longer range
forecasting, using weekly and monthly charts going back several years, has proven to be
an extremely useful application on these techniques.
###LESS RELIANCE ON MARKET AVERAGES AND INDICATORS
Stock market analysis is based heavily on the movement of broad market averages--
such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. In addition, technical indicators that measure the strength or weakness of the broader market-- like the NYSE advance-decline line or the new highs-new lows list--are heavily employed.

##Chapter 2. Dow Theory
###BASIC TENETS
1. The Averages Discount Everything.
2. The Market Has Three Trends.
Dow believes that the law of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, "Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to decline some distance". Dow considered a trend to have three parts, *primary*, *secondary*, and *minor*, which he compared to the tide, waves. and ripples of the sea.
3. Major Trends Have Three Phases.

Accumulation phase:

Participation phase:

Distribution phase:
4. The Averages Must Confirm Each Other.
Dow meant that no important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other.
5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend.

Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, *volume should expand or increase in the direction of the major trend*.

6. A Trend Is Assumed to Be in Effect Until It Gives Definite Signals That It Has Reversed.

It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in
motion until some external force causes it to change direction.

The most difficult task for a Dow theorist, or any trend-follower for that matter, it being able to distinguish between a normal
secondary correction in an existing trend and the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction.

**THE USE OF CLOSING PRICES AND THE PRESENCE OF LINES**
Dow relied exclusively on *closing prices*. He believed that averages had to close higher than a previous peak or lower than a previous trough to have significance.

##Chapter 4. Basic Concepts of Trend

**DEFINITION OF TREND**
In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the market, which way it's moving. Market moves are characterized by a series of *zigzags*.
These zigzags resemble a series of successive waves with fairly obvious
peaks and troughs. *It is the direction of those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend*.

**TREND HAS THREE DIRECTIONS**

We've mentioned an uptrend, downtrend, and sideways trend for a very good reason. Most technical tools and systems are trend-following in nature, which means that they are primarily designed for markets that are moving up or down, They usually work very poorly, or not at all, when markets enter these lateral or "trendless" phases.

There are three decisions confronting the trader-- whether to buy a market, sell a market, or do nothing. When a market is rising, the buying strategy is preferable. When it is falling, the second approach would be correct. However, when the market is moving sideways, the third choice-- to stay out of the market-- is usually the wisest.

**TREND HAS THREE CLASSIFICATION**

1. Major,
2. Intermediate, and
3. Near term trends.

Each trend becomes a portion of its next larger trend.
![trend-classification](./trend-classification.png)
As a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes.
In an intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate long positions.

**SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE**
The troughs, or reaction lows, are called *support*. The term is self-explanatory and
indicates that support is a level or area on the chart under the market where buying interest
is sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and
prices turn back up again. Usually a support level is identified beforehand by a previous reaction low.

Resistance is the opposite of support and represents a price level or area over the market where
selling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back. Usually a resistance
level is identified by previous peak.

**How Support and Resistance Levels Reverse Their Roles**

![double](./double.png)

**The Psychology of Support and Resistance**

In a financial market, there are three types of participants, at any given price level:

- Traders who are long and waiting for price to rise
- Traders who are short and hoping that price will fall
- Traders who have not decided which way to trade

As price rises from a support level, the traders who are long are happy and may consider adding to their positions if price drops back down to the same support level. The traders who are short in this situation are beginning to question their positions, and may buy to cover (exit the position) to get out at, or near, breakeven, if price reaches the support level again. The traders who did not enter the market previously at this price level, may be ready to pounce and go long, if price comes back down to the support level. In essence, a large number of traders may be eagerly waiting to buy at this level, adding to its strength as an area of support. If all these participants do buy at this level, price will likely rebound from the support once again.

Price can, however, fall right through the support level. As price continues to drop, traders will quickly realize that the support level is not holding. The long traders may wait for price to climb back up to the previous support level, which will now act as resistance, to exit their trades in the hopes of limiting their losses. The short traders are now happy and may consider adding to their positions, if price revisits the price level. Lastly, the traders who did not enter the market yet may go short, if price comes back to the previous support level, in anticipation of price dropping further. Again, a large number of traders may be ready to make a move at this level, but now instead of buying, they will be selling. This same behavior can be witnessed in reverse with traders' reactions to resistance levels.

**The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or resistance area, the more significant that area becomes.** For example, if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before moving higher, that support are would be more import than if only three days of trading had occurred.

**Volume is another way to measure the significance of support and resistance.** If a support level is formed on heavy volume, this would indicate that a large number of units changed hands, and would mark that support level as more important than if very little trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure intraday trading activity are especially useful in identifying these price levels where most of the trading took place and, consequently, where support and resistance will be most likely to function.

**A third way to determine the significance of a support or resistance area is how recently the trading took place.**
Because  we are dealing with the reaction of traders to market movement and to positions that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes.

**Support Becoming Resistance and Vice Versa: Degree of Penetration.**
It was mentioned earlier that the distance prices traveled away from support or resistance increased the significance of that support or resistance. There is quite a bit of subjectivity involved here in determining whether a penetration is significant or not. As a benchmark, some chartists use a 3% penetration as a criteria, particularly for major support and resistance levels. Shorter term support and resistance areas would probably require a much smaller number, like 1%.

**The Importance of Round Numbers as Support and Resistance**

There  is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines. Traders tend to think in terms of important round numbers, such as 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as price objectives and act accordingly. These round numbers, therefore, will often act as "Pyschological" support or resistance levels. A trader can use this information to begin taking profits as an important round number is approached.
One trading application of this principle is to **avoid placing trading orders right at these obvious round numbers**.
As a general rule, **avoid placing protective stops at obvious round numbers**.
In other words, protective stops on long positions should be placed below round numbers and on short positions, above such numbers.

**TRENDINESS**

An **up trendline** is a straight line drawn upward to the right along successive reaction lows. A **down trendline** is drawn downward to the right along successive rally peaks.
![trendline](./trendline.png)

***Tentative Versus the valid Trendline***
In order to confirm the validity of a trendline, however, that line should be touched a third time with prices bouncing off of it.
To summarize, two points are needed to draw the trendline, and a third point to make it a valid trendline.

**How to Use the Trendline**

One f the basic concepts of trend is that a trend in motion will tend to remain in motion, As a corollary to that, once a trend assumeds a certain slope or rate of speed, as identified by the trendline, it will usually maintain the same slope. The trendline then helps not only to determine the extremities of the corrective phase, but maybe even more importantly, tells us when that trend is changing.

Very often, ***the breaking of the trendline is one of the best early warning of a change in trend***.
![break-trendline](./break-trendline.png)

**How to Determine the Significance of a Trendline**

What determines the significance of a trendline? The answer to that question is twofold--*the longer it has been intact and the number of times it has been tested*.
The more significant the trendline, the more confidence it inspires and the more important is its penetration.

**Trendlines Should Include All Price Action**

Trendlines on bar charts should be drawn over or under the entire day's price range.
![trend all prices](trend-all-price.png)

**How to Handle Small Trendline Penetrations**

![trend-penetration](./trend-penetration.png)
Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast rule to follow in such a situation. Sometimes it is best to ignore the minor breach, especially if subsequent market action proves that the original line is still valid.

**What Constitutes a Valid Breaking of a Trendline?**

As a general rule, **a close beyond the trendline is more significant than
just an intraday penetration**.
There is tradeoff involved in the use of any type of filter. If the filter is too small, it won't be very useful in reducing the impact of whipsaws. If it's too big, then much of the initial move will be missed before a valid signal is given. Here again, the trader must determine what type of
filter is best suited to the degree of trend being followed, always making allowances for the differences in the individuals markets.

An alternative to a price filter is time filter. A common time filter is the **two day rule**. In other words, to have a valid breaking of a trendline, prices must close beyond trendline for two successive days. To break an up trendline, therefore, prices must close under the trendline two days in a row. A one day violation would not count. The 1-3% rule and the two day rule are also applied to breaking of important support and resistance levels, not just to major trendlines. Another filter would require a Friday close beyond a major breakout point to ensure a weekly signal.


**How Trendlines Reverse Roles**

It's surprising how often old trendlines act as support and resistance lines again in the future, but in the opposite role.

**Measuring Implications of Trendlines**

Price Objectives:

**THE FAN PRINCIPLE**

![fan](./trend-fan.png)
**The breaking of that third trendline is usually an indication that prices are headed lower.**
The term "fan principle" derives from the appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling a fan. ***The important point to remember here is that the breaking of the third line is the valid trend reversal signal.***
![fan](./trend-real-fan.png)

**THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NUMBER THREE**

For whatever the reason, the number three plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical analysis.

**THE RELATIVE STEEPNESS OF THE TRENDLINE**

The 45 degree line was one of the techniques favored by W.D.Gann. Such a
line reflects a situation where prices are advancing or declining at such a rate that price and time are in perfect balance.

**How to Adjust Trendlines**

Sometimes trendlines have to be adjusted to fit a slowing or an accelerating trend.
![adjust](./trend-adjust.png)
![adjust](./trend-accelarate.png)
All of the techniques covered in this book work well in certain situations, but not so well in others. By having an arsenal of tools to fall back on, the technician can quickly switch from one tool to another that might work better in a given situation.
An accelerated trend is one of those cases where a moving average would be more useful than a series of steeper and steeper trendlines.
